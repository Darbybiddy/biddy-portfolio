## Challenges
I put in a lot of hours working on this portfolio. I will be continuing to edit this as i want it to be my actual portfolio. 

I struggled quite a bit with learning flexbox and how it pertains to certain elements. 
I was scrambling for time to get this project done to the best of my abilities. 
I struggled with the images uploading to github. had some errors that prevented me from pushing my edits to git hub and trying to resolve those issues set me back a bit on the design side of the webiste.
